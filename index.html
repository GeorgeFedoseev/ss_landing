        <div id="idea_vp_desc">
          While we may, depending on our type of sleep, metabolic rate and other factors, actually need only five to eight hours of sleep, Mother Nature has given us a daily average of 12 hours of darkness. As a result, humans living in the pre-artificial light ages developed what has come to be called a “biphasic” sleep pattern in which people cycled between sleep states and waking states all during those long dark nights. Reportedly the norm until the late 1800’s when the development of electric lighting and the lifestyle inherent in the phrase “Gay 90’s” caused people to stay awake long into the wee hours, the benefits of biphasic sleep -- and later polyphasic sleep -- over monophasic sleep have been documented in scientific studies and experiments made over a period spanning three centuries.

Virtually every bit of research on power naps proves that they help to refresh your mind, enable you to work more effectively and keep you feeling energized and rested all day long.

              Polyphasic sleep is one of the world’s most valuable life hacks because it increases your supply of conscious time – the rarest, most non-renewable, natural resource of them all – by three to four hours a day. Day after day, week after week, year after year. It’s like having close to two months a year added to your life. What could be better than that?

              Polyphaslc sleep is all about dividing your daily sleep into several rigidly scheduled time periods. It replaces the average person’s chaotic approach to sleep with an organized approach. The subconscious mind becomes conditioned to expecting to sleep, needing to sleep, wanting to sleep at a specific time. Which eliminates one of the most common causes of insomnia, the subconscious desperately trying to send the message that it is simply not ready to sleep at the time dictated by the conscious mind.

        <div id="how_title">How Does Polyphasic Sleep Work?</div>        
        <div id="how_desc1">
          <b>Sleep is an iterative process</b> in which the brain wakes up and goes back to sleep four to five times during every normal sleep session In typical monophasic sleepers each of these four or five cycles lasts about 1.5 hours. Each contains five separate and distinct phases, some of which are essential to quality sleep and some of which are largely irrelevant.

        <div id="how_desc2">
          <div id="how_desc2_left"></div>
          <div id="how_desc2_right">
            Separating one long sleep session into several small ones does many positive things. It forces the body to utilize each sleeping period more efficiently by reducing the amount of time devoted to the less useful, more wakeful sleep phases. Relatively little time is allocated to phases one and two, which are basically devoted to adjusting your brainwave rate low enough to enter a deeper level of sleep. By the same token the third and fourth cycles, during which the brain performs such essential “housekeeping” tasks as healing and reenergizing get proportionally more sleep time. Finally, the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase, during which the brain is at its most creative, is given the largest slice of the sleeping pie.

            <div class="steps_phase_body">
              In this initial stage your 7-8 hour sleeping period is split up into two 3.5-4 hour intervals with a 1.5-2 hour break in between. Typically, you won’t feel any negative effects as your body slowly starts to change its sleeping habits.

            <div class="steps_phase_body">
              Learning to nap is the tricky part. First, you reduce the length of your second sleeping interval to two hours and try to take a half hour nap during the day. Generally, falling asleep for a daytime nap requires some patience and determination. You might start by just closing your eyes and trying to relax. Since you are sleeping less at night you may feel a bit sleepy in the middle of the day. Within a short period you’ll discover that you’re regularly falling into a deep restful sleep at exactly the time programmed for your nap.

            <div class="steps_phase_body">
              Once you’ve learned how to nap, you can easily save even more time by converting your second core sleep interval into two 30-minutes naps. After another brief period of adjustment you should be able to cut your standard nap down to just 20 minutes.
